Datasets: [million_song_dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/) and [genre_labels](https://www.tagtraum.com/msd_genre_datasets.html)

Main research question(s): 

1) How can we visually represent large song datasets using an interactive 2-dimensional map?
2) How can we effectively compute the probability distribution of a song across a given set of genres?
